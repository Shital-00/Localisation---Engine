•	Localisation – Engine is tool , which is used for transferring one language game into another language game.
•	Also, It is used for transferring UI from one language to another language with the help of importing json file data or string file data.
•	Basically the Audio files and text files with one language of whole game can be converted into another language.
•	It is made in such a way that all data of Game or UI or screen of any application is packed with json files in dictionary format and these data’s are available in multiple language so we have to just send the key’s of data and display whole data with the values.
•	It is better, when we have to make a game or UI design having same data but in multiple language so basically we have to just make a one game or UI design and click option button like English language , Spanish language, Chinese language And whole game or UI design is converted into another language .
Simply we have to open and run the project on unity editor , select option which you have to convert game or UI and the whole game or UI is open in that language which you have to select.
